# Fourth Code Challenge - Eniac I Alpha EdTech

## The challange

Develop a full SPA for some online service. One month for development. Initially I chose to create an app to register purchases and generate payables and stock.
I had to downsize the project a (big) bit to meet the deadline.

## Requirements (assigned by the instructor)

* React, Node and PostgreSQL;

* CRUD API;

## Future improvements

1. Finish interface;
2. Refactor back-end routes, controllers and query methods;
3. Separate front-end and back-end package.json properly;
4. Document use of PostgreSQL

# Run this app
1. On project root, install back-end dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

2. Start server

```shell
npm start
```

3. Enter `/frontend` directory and install react dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Start development server for front end:
```shell
npm start
```

5. Open `https://localhost/3000` on your browser

*You will need a PostgreSQL server running to open this app*
